# Confident Asset Deployments with Webpack & Django

This is my 2016 talk for DjangoCon. Probably not much to see now.

## Colophon

This presentation is built with [Spectacle](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle) using the [boilerplate](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle-boilerplate).

### Reference

The Spectacle core API is available at [https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/spectacle/blob/master/README.markdown).

### Development

After cloning this repo, your first order of business is to open terminal and run `npm install`

Then, to start up the local server, run `npm start`

Open a browser and hit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the presentation.

### Build & Deployment

Building the dist version of the project is as easy as running `npm run build`

If you want to deploy the slideshow to surge, run `npm run deploy`

TODO: Link to a deployed version.
